/*
5. Create a function that reverses an array
This challenge is particularly helpful if youâ€™re planning to become a Data Scientist. 
Manipulating data is a significant part of the role, and building 
the foundations now will help you later down the road when youâ€™re working with large databases.
Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, 
and then try your program with a larger array to verify its success.

function reverseArray (ArraySize){


var Array = [];


for (var i = Array.length -1 ; i >= 0 ;i --){

    Array.push= (ArraySize[i])
}


console.log ("reserved array is " + Array[i])
}




reverseArray([4, 5225])


function reverseArray(arr) {
    var reversed = []; // Initialize an empty array

    // Loop through the array in reverse order and push elements into `reversed`
    for (var i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        reversed.push(arr[i]);
    }

    console.log("Reversed array is: " + reversed);
    return reversed;
}

// Test with a sample array
reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
