/* 1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible. Consider using loops 
that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print
the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work
up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.  */
